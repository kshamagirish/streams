<h2>Programming Project 3</h2>
<h3>Due Monday, April 1 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p><em><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Read the
<strong>Do's and Dont's</strong>
in the <strong>Course Honor Policy</strong> found on blackboard. </em>
</p>


<h3>I. Overview</h3>

<p>The purpose of this project is to give you practice designing a class/type hierarchy.  It is <em>important</em>
that you spend time designing your class hierarchy <em>before</em> you start coding.  
If you properly organize your classes and/or interfaces, you can achieve the desired program behavior below with significantly
less code than with a poorly organized hierarchy.
This project will also how there are limitations to what we can do with Java's classes and interfaces.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II. Code Readability (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p><strong>New for this assignment:</strong> The comments above the class or interface and above each method must be written
in JavaDoc format.  You will be introduced to JavaDoc style commenting in the labs.  You can also find
a description in the <em>Java in a Nutshell</em> text.  Be sure to run JavaDoc and view the webpage in order to 
verify that you have implemented the comments correctly.</p>

<p>To receive the full readability marks, your code must follow the following guideline:
<ul>
<li>All variables (fields, parameters, local variables) must be given appropriate and descriptive names.</li>
<li>All variable and method names must start with a lowercase letter.  All class and interface names must start with an uppercase letter.</li>
<li>The class body should be organized so that all the fields are at the top of the file, the
constructors are next, the non-static methods next, and the static methods at the bottom.</li>
<li>There should not be two statements on the same line.</li>
<li>All code must be properly indented (see page 644 of the Lewis book for an example of good style).
    The amount of indentation is up to you, but it should be at least 2 spaces, and it must be used
    consistently throughout the code.</li>
<li>You must be consistent in your use of {, }.  The closing } must be on its own line and indented
the same amount as the line containing the opening {.</li>
<li>There must be an empty line between each method.</li>
<li>There must be a space separating each operator from its operands as well as a space after each comma.</li>
<li>There must be a comment at the top of the file that <strong>is in proper JavaDoc format</strong> and
includes both your name and a description of what the class represents.  The comment should include tags for the author.</li>
<li>There must be a comment directly above each method (including constructors) that <strong>is in proper JavaDoc format</strong>
 and states <em>what</em> task the method is doing, not how it is doing it.  The comment should include
 tags for any parameters, return values and exceptions, and the tags should include appropriate comments
 that indicate the purpose of the inputs, the value returned, and the meaning of the exceptions.</li>
<li>There must be a comment directly above each field that, in one line, states what the field is storing.</li>
<li>There must be a comment either above or to the right of each non-field variable indicating what the variable is storing.  Any comments placed to the right should be aligned so they start on the same column.</li>
<li>There must be a comment above each loop that indicates the purpose of the loop.  Ideally, the comment would
consist of any preconditions (if they exist) and the subgoal for the loop iteration.</li>
<li>Any code that is complicated should have a short comment either above it or aligned to the right that
explains the logic of the code.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>III. Program Testing (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p><strong>New for this assignment:</strong> The testing routines should be included in a JUnit test class.
</p>

<p>You are to write a test report that indicates the <em>types</em> of tests needed to thoroughly test 
your project.  The tests should demonstrate that all of your methods behave correctly.  An conditional statements
will need tests that go through each branch of the execution.  Any loops will need tests that cover the
"test 0, test 1, test many" and "test first, test middle, test last" guidelines.  Your testing report should
<em>not</em> list the actual tests and results.</p>

<p>You are to have a JUnit test class or classes that implement each of the needed tests.  Comments and method
names in your JUnit class should connect to your testing report.  
For example, if your testing report states "<em>method <tt>xxx</tt> must be tested with string inputs of different lengths</em>", 
then the reader should be able to go to the JUnit class and easily identify the tests that test that method on inputs of length 0, 1, and more than 1.</p>

<p><em>The testing report must be separate from the JUnit class.</em> In most companies, the testing document
will be written in a style that allows both programmers and non-programmers to read it and recognize whether all the
needed test cases were included.</p>
<hr>

<h3>IV. Java Programming (60% of your grade)</h3>
<p>
<p><strong>Design Rules:</strong> Your project must contain the following seven types and each type must contain the listed methods.
The project <em>may</em> use any combination of classes, abstract classes, or interfaces that you feel is appropriate.
The project <em>may</em> add additional types to the ones listed.
The classes/types <em>may</em> contain additional methods to the ones listed if you 
feel they are needed.
You may use any combination of inheritance, method overriding, and method overloading to achieve the needed behavior.
Part of the coding grade will be the quality of the hierarchy you create. 
</p>

<p><strong>Hint (repeated from above):</strong> Spend a lot of time designing your hierarchy <em>before</em> you code.  A well designed hierarchy
will reduce the amount of code you have to write.</p>

<p><strong>A note on types:</strong> you may find <em>generic types</em> and <em>wrapper classes</em> to be useful in this assignment though they are not required.
We will be covering both generic types and wrapper classes before this project is due <em>but, again, they are not required for this project</em>.  If you know about
generic types and wrapper classes and want to use them, you are welcome to do so because they can help reduce your coding.  However, you should use them properly.  That means that if the compiler gives you a warning message that you are using
one incorrectly, be sure to correct the error and do not submit code that gives warnings.</p>


<h3>Programming (60% of the project grade)</h3>


<p>For this project you will implement <em>streams</em>.  A <em>stream</em> is a class that produces (theoretically) infinite amounts of data.
We will create both simple streams as well as neat streams such as a stream of all primes using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.</p>

<p>Your project should contain the following types.  Each type can be a class or an interface.  You may need to create additional types to 
accomplish all the tasks.  The goal is to write a good hierachy that limits the amount of code you need to write:
<ol>
<li><p><tt>IntegerStream</tt>:  An integer stream produces a continuous sequence of integers, starting at some initial integer.  Each subsequence integer produced
should be one more than the previous integer.  The class will need the following methods and constructors:
    <ol><li><p>The constructor takes an integer that represents the first value returned by the stream.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>next():</tt> Takes no input and returns the next value of the stream starting at the initial value.  Each time next is called, the number returned should be one more than what was returned the previous time next was called, </p></li>
    </ol>
For example, if you create <tt>stream = new IntegerStream(10);</tt> then calling <tt>stream.next()</tt> should produce the following:
<pre>
> stream.next()
10
> stream.next()
11
> stream.next()
12
</pre></p></li>
<li><p><tt>StringStream</tt>: A string stream produces a continuous sequence of strings that consist of lower case letters, in lexicographical order.  
(The strings in lexicographical order are: <tt>{ "", "a", "b", ..., "z", "aa", "ab", ..., "az", "ba", "bb", ..., "bz", ..., "zz", "aaa", "aab", ...}</tt>.)
The class will need the following methods and constructors:
    <ol><li><p>The constructor takes a <tt>String</tt> that represents the first value returned by the stream. (The behavior if the input is not all lowercase letters is up to you.)</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>next:</tt> Takes no input and returns the next value of the stream, i.e. it returns the string that is next in the lexicographical ordering from the previous value returned by <tt>next</tt>.</p></li>
    </ol>
For example, if you create <tt>stream = new StringStream("pez");</tt> then calling <tt>stream.next()</tt> should produce the following:
<pre>
> stream.next()
"pez"
> stream.next()
"pfa"
> stream.next()
"pfb"
</pre></p></li>
<li><p><tt>NotMultipleFilter</tt>: a filter is used to apply a certain test to data.  A filter also contains an <em>upstream filter</em> so that this filter can be part of a chain of filters.
In this case, we want to determine if an integer is not divisible by some value.
The class will need the following methods and constructors:
    <ol><li><p>The constructor takes two values: an integer and another filter.  The integer is the <em>base value</em> for the filter, and the other filter is the <em>upstream filter</em>.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>passFilter</tt>: takes an integer value and returns true or false.  The method should return true if the value both passes the upstream filter and is not divisible by this filter's base value.</p></li>
    </ol></p></li>
<li><p><tt>PalindromeFilter</tt>: a filter is used to apply a certain test to data.  A filter also contains an <em>upstream filter</em> so that this filter can be part of a chain of filters.
In this case, we want to determine if a string is a palindrome.
The class will need the following methods and constructors:
    <ol><li><p>The constructor takes a filter that will be the <em>upstream filter</em>.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>passFilter</tt>: takes a string value and returns true or false.  The method should return true if the value both passes the upstream filter and is a palindrome (is identical forwards as backwards).</p></li>
    </ol></p></li>
<li><p><tt>NotMultipleStream</tt>: a stream that returns, in numeric order, integers that are not multiples of a certain value, starting from an initial value.  The NotMultipleStream should behave like an IntegerStream, but
it should include a NotMultipleFilter to filter out multiples of a certain value. 
The class will need the following methods and constructors:
    <ol><li><p>The constructor takes two integer values.  The first is the <em>base value</em> and the second is the <em>initial value</em>.</p></li>
	    <p><tt>next</tt>: takes no input and returns an integer.  The first value returned by <tt>next</tt> should be the the smallest number, no smaller than the <em>initial value</em> such that the number is not divisible by the <em>base value</em>.  Each subsequent call should return the next largest integer that is not a multiple of the <em>base value</em>.</p></li>
    </ol></p></li>
<li><p><tt>PalindromeStream</tt>: a stream that returns all palindromes, consisting of only lower case letters, in lexicographical order.
The class will need the following methods and constructors:
    <ol><li><p>The constructor takes a single string that will be the <em>initial value</em>. You may assume the string is all lower case letters, but you may not assume it is a palindrome. </p></li>
        <li><p><tt>next</tt>: Takes no input and returns the next value of the stream.  The first value returned should be the lexicographically smallest palindrome that is no smaller than the initial value.
                              Each subsequenct call should return the next palindrome in lexicographical order.</p></li>
    </ol></p></li>
<li><p><tt>PrimeStream</tt>: a stream that returns all prime numbers, in order, starting at 2.  Tne stream will use the Sieve of Eratosthenes technique.
The class will need the following methods and constructors:
    <ol><li><p>The constructor takes no input.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>next</tt>: Takes no input and returns the next prime number, in order.  The first time it is called, it should return 2.  Each time next is called, it should take the return value,
                              create a <tt>NoMultiplesFilter</tt> with that number as the base and the current filter as the <em>upstream filter</em> and make this new filter the filter of the stream.
			      As a result, the stream should no longer produce multiples of the last number (or all previous numbers) output by the next method.</p></li>
    </ol></p></li>
<li><p><tt>IntegerPair</tt>: a class that represents a pair of integers.
The class will need the following methods and constructors:
    <ol><li><p>The constructor takes two integers.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>getValue1</tt> takes no input and returns the first value of the pair.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>getValue2</tt> takes no input and returns the second value of the pair.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>toString</tt> overrides the <tt>toString</tt> method of <tt>Object</tt> to return a string representation of the pair.  The representation should be the two integers, separated by a comma, and inside parentheses.
		For example, <tt>"(3,4)"</tt>.</p></li>
    </ol></p></li>
<li><p><tt>TwinPrimeStream</tt>: a stream that returns <tt>IntegerPair</tt>'s that represent twin primes.  A twin prime is a set of two primes that differ by two.  For example, (3,5), (5,7), and (11,13) are twin primes.
                The stream should initially return (3,5), and then each subsequent pair, with the smaller prime appearing first, in numeric order of the smaller prime.
The class will need the following methods and constructors:
    <ol><li><p>The constructor takes no input.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>next</tt>: returns the next integer pair of twin primes, in numeric order, starting with (3,5).</p></li>
    </ol></p></li>
<li><p><tt>MersennePrimeStream</tt>: a stream that returns primes of the form 2^x -1., starting with the smallest such prime.  
The class will need the following methods and constructors:
    <ol><li><p>The constructor takes no input.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>next</tt>: returns the next Mersenne prime.  (Hint: You need to get the next prime and then determine if one more than that number is a power of 2.</p></li>
    </ol> Note that using the Sieve of Eratoshenes to find Mersenne primes is quite inefficient.  You will not be able to find more than the first five before blowing up the stack.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>StreamUtilities</tt>: a collection of (sort of) useful things to do with streams.
The class should have the following methods:
    <ol><li><p><tt>print</tt>: takes two inputs: a stream and an integer.  Uses <tt>System.out.println</tt> to print the first <em>x</em> values returned by the stream, where <em>x</em> is the integer input to the method.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>sum</tt>: takes a stream that produces integers and an integer as input and returns an integer.  The method returns the <em>sum</em> of the first <em>x</em> values of the stream, where <em>x</em> is the integer input to the method.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>product</tt>: takes a stream that produces integers and an integer as input and returns an integer.  The method returns the <em>product</em> of the first <em>x</em> values of the stream, where <em>x</em> is the integer input to the method.</p></li>
        <li><p><tt>concatenate</tt>: takes a stream that produces strings and an integer as input and returns a string.  The method returns the <em>concatenation</em> of the first <em>x</em> values of the stream, where <em>x</em> is the integer input to the method.</p></li> 
    </ol></p></li>
</ol>
